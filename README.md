Please use API 33 or higher and light mode when using this app. (Pixel 4 API 33 runs perfectly)

Be careful of uploading images that are too large, as if an image that is too big is uploaded, recipe will crash, and then will have to be deleted on FireStore.
Additionally don't upload PNG images (JPEG/JPG preferred).

FOR INTENT TESTS: Occasionally, camera app or emulator will experience a freeze unrelated to the tests. This can cause false negatives, and tests should be rerun. Additionally, any test items added to database should be removed prior to rerunning tests. December 20th is used for meal plan testing, so when running tests this day should be left free.
